Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p 1 , … , p n p 1 , … , p n and an array a 1 , … , a n a 1 , … , a n . They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".
A permutation of length n n is an array consisting of n n distinct integers from 1 1 to n n in arbitrary order. For example, [ 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 4 ] [ 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 4 ] is a permutation, but [ 1 , 2 , 2 ] [ 1 , 2 , 2 ] is not a permutation ( 2 2 appears twice in the array), and [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] is also not a permutation ( n = 3 n = 3 but there is 4 4 in the array).
Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.
The game lasts k k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn, two things happen to each player:
Knowing Bodya's starting position P B P B and Sasha's starting position P S P S , determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.
