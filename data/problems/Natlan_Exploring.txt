You are exploring the stunning region of Natlan! This region consists of n n cities, and each city is rated with an attractiveness a i a i . A directed edge exists from City i i to City j j if and only if i < j i < j and gcd ( a i , a j ) ≠ 1 gcd ( a i , a j ) ≠ 1 , where gcd ( x , y ) gcd ( x , y ) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers x x and y y .

Starting from City 1 1 , your task is to determine the total number of distinct paths you can take to reach City n n , modulo 998 244 353 998 244 353 . Two paths are different if and only if the set of cities visited is different.
