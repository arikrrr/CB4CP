You are given a permutation p p of size n n , as well as a non-negative integer k k . You need to construct a permutation q q of size n n such that inv ( q ) + inv ( q ⋅ p ) = k † ‡ inv ⁡ ( q ) + inv ⁡ ( q ⋅ p ) = k † ‡ , or determine if it is impossible to do so.
† † For two permutations p p and q q of the same size n n , the permutation w = q ⋅ p w = q ⋅ p is such that w i = q p i w i = q p i for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n 1 ≤ i ≤ n .
‡ ‡ For a permutation p p of size n n , the function inv ( p ) inv ⁡ ( p ) returns the number of inversions of p p , i.e. the number of pairs of indices 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n such that p i > p j p i > p j .
