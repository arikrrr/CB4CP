In Berland, coins of worth 1 1 , 3 3 and 5 5 burles are commonly used (burles are local currency).
Eva has to pay exactly n n burles in a shop. She has an infinite amount of coins of all three types. However, she doesn't like to pay using coins worth 1 1 burle â€” she thinks they are the most convenient to use.
Help Eva to calculate the minimum number of coins worth 1 1 burle she has to use, if she has to pay exactly n n burles. Note that she can spend any number of coins worth 3 3 and/or 5 5 burles.
