Fox loves permutations! She came up with the following problem and asked Cat to solve it:
You are given an even positive integer n n and a permutation † † p p of length n n .
The score of another permutation q q of length n n is the number of local maximums in the array a a of length n n , where a i = p i + q i a i = p i + q i for all i i ( 1 ≤ i ≤ n 1 ≤ i ≤ n ). In other words, the score of q q is the number of i i such that 1 < i < n 1 < i < n (note the strict inequalities), a i − 1 < a i a i − 1 < a i , and a i > a i + 1 a i > a i + 1 (once again, note the strict inequalities).
Find the permutation q q that achieves the maximum score for given n n and p p . If there exist multiple such permutations, you can pick any of them.
† † A permutation of length n n is an array consisting of n n distinct integers from 1 1 to n n in arbitrary order. For example, [ 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 4 ] [ 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 4 ] is a permutation, but [ 1 , 2 , 2 ] [ 1 , 2 , 2 ] is not a permutation ( 2 2 appears twice in the array), and [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] is also not a permutation ( n = 3 n = 3 but there is 4 4 in the array).
