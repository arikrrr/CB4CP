It's another beautiful day on Farmer John's farm.
After Farmer John arrived at his farm, he counted n n legs. It is known only chickens and cows live on the farm, and a chicken has 2 2 legs while a cow has 4 4 .
What is the minimum number of animals Farmer John can have on his farm assuming he counted the legs of all animals?
