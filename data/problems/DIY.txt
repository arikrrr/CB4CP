You are given a list of n n integers a 1 , a 2 , … , a n a 1 , a 2 , … , a n . You need to pick 8 8 elements from the list and use them as coordinates of four points. These four points should be corners of a rectangle which has its sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Your task is to pick coordinates in such a way that the resulting rectangle has the maximum possible area. The rectangle can be degenerate, i. e. its area can be 0 0 . Each integer can be used as many times as it occurs in the list (or less).
