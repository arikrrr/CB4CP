You are given two strings a a and b b of length n n . Then, you are (forced against your will) to answer q q queries.
For each query, you are given a range bounded by l l and r r . In one operation, you can choose an integer i i ( l ≤ i ≤ r l ≤ i ≤ r ) and set a i = x a i = x where x x is any character you desire. Output the minimum number of operations you must perform such that sorted(a[l..r]) = sorted(b[l..r]) sorted(a[l..r]) = sorted(b[l..r]) . The operations you perform on one query does not affect other queries.
For an arbitrary string c c , sorted(c[l..r]) sorted(c[l..r]) denotes the substring consisting of characters c l , c l + 1 , . . . , c r c l , c l + 1 , . . . , c r sorted in lexicographical order.
