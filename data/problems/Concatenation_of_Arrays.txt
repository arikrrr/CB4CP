You are given n n arrays a 1 a 1 , … … , a n a n . The length of each array is two. Thus, a i = [ a i , 1 , a i , 2 ] a i = [ a i , 1 , a i , 2 ] . You need to concatenate the arrays into a single array of length 2 n 2 n such that the number of inversions † † in the resulting array is minimized. Note that you do not need to count the actual number of inversions.

More formally, you need to choose a permutation ‡ ‡ p p of length n n , so that the array b = [ a p 1 , 1 , a p 1 , 2 , a p 2 , 1 , a p 2 , 2 , … , a p n , 1 , a p n , 2 ] b = [ a p 1 , 1 , a p 1 , 2 , a p 2 , 1 , a p 2 , 2 , … , a p n , 1 , a p n , 2 ] contains as few inversions as possible.

† † The number of inversions in an array c c is the number of pairs of indices i i and j j such that i < j i < j and c i > c j c i > c j .

‡ ‡ A permutation of length n n is an array consisting of n n distinct integers from 1 1 to n n in arbitrary order. For example, [ 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 4 ] [ 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 4 ] is a permutation, but [ 1 , 2 , 2 ] [ 1 , 2 , 2 ] is not a permutation ( 2 2 appears twice in the array), and [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] is also not a permutation ( n = 3 n = 3 but there is 4 4 in the array).
