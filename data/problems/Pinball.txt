There is a one-dimensional grid of length n n . The i i -th cell of the grid contains a character s i s i , which is either ' < ' or ' > '.
When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the following rules:
You need to answer n n independent queries. In the i i -th query, a pinball will be placed on the i i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the initial grid.
For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a finite number of steps.
