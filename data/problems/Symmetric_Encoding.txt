Polycarp has a string s s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He encodes this string using the following algorithm:
For example, encoding the string s s =" codeforces " happens as follows:
Thus, the result of encoding the string s s =" codeforces " is the string " serofedsoc ".
Write a program that performs decoding â€” that is, restores the original string s s from the encoding result.
