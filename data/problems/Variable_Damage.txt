Monocarp is gathering an army to fight a dragon in a videogame.

The army consists of two parts: the heroes and the defensive artifacts. Each hero has one parameter — his health. Each defensive artifact also has one parameter — its durability.

Before the battle begins, Monocarp distributes artifacts to the heroes so that each hero receives at most one artifact.

The battle consists of rounds that proceed as follows:

The battle ends when there are no heroes left alive.

Initially, the army is empty. There are q q queries: add a hero with health x x or an artifact with durability y y to the army. After each query, determine the maximum number of rounds that Monocarp can survive if he distributes the artifacts optimally.
