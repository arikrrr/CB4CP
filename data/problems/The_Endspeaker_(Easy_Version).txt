This is the easy version of this problem. The only difference is that you only need to output the minimum total cost of operations in this version. You must solve both versions to be able to hack.

You're given an array a a of length n n , and an array b b of length m m ( b i > b i + 1 b i > b i + 1 for all 1 ≤ i < m 1 ≤ i < m ). Initially, the value of k k is 1 1 . Your aim is to make the array a a empty by performing one of these two operations repeatedly:

You need to minimize the total cost of the operations to make array a a empty. If it's impossible to do this through any sequence of operations, output − 1 − 1 . Otherwise, output the minimum total cost of the operations.
