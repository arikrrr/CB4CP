There is a hidden array a a of n n positive integers. You know that a a is a palindrome , or in other words, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n 1 ≤ i ≤ n , a i = a n + 1 − i a i = a n + 1 − i . You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the n ( n + 1 ) 2 n ( n + 1 ) 2 distinct subarrays of a a .
Recover any possible palindrome a a . The input is chosen such that there is always at least one array a a that satisfies the conditions.
An array b b is a subarray of a a if b b can be obtained from a a by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
