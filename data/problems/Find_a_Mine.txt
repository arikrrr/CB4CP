This is an interactive problem.
You are given a grid with n n rows and m m columns. The coordinates ( x , y ) ( x , y ) represent the cell on the grid, where x x ( 1 ≤ x ≤ n 1 ≤ x ≤ n ) is the row number counting from the top and y y ( 1 ≤ y ≤ m 1 ≤ y ≤ m ) is the column number counting from the left. It is guaranteed that there are exactly 2 2 mines in the grid at distinct cells, denoted as ( x 1 , y 1 ) ( x 1 , y 1 ) and ( x 2 , y 2 ) ( x 2 , y 2 ) . You are allowed to make no more than 4 4 queries to the interactor, and after these queries, you need to provide the location of one of the mines .
In each query, you can choose any grid cell ( x , y ) ( x , y ) , and in return, you will receive the minimum Manhattan distance from both the mines to the chosen cell, i.e., you will receive the value min ( | x − x 1 | + | y − y 1 | , | x − x 2 | + | y − y 2 | ) min ( | x − x 1 | + | y − y 1 | , | x − x 2 | + | y − y 2 | ) .
Your task is to determine the location of one of the mines after making the queries.
