Given an integer n n , you construct an array a a of n n integers, where a i = i a i = i for all integers i i in the range [ 1 , n ] [ 1 , n ] . An operation on this array is defined as follows:
After all the operations a i ≤ 10 18 a i ≤ 10 18 should hold for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n 1 ≤ i ≤ n .
We can show that an answer always exists.
