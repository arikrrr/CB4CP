The magical girl Nene has an n × n n × n matrix a a filled with zeroes. The j j -th element of the i i -th row of matrix a a is denoted as a i , j a i , j .
She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:
Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix ∑ i = 1 n ∑ j = 1 n a i , j ∑ i = 1 n ∑ j = 1 n a i , j . She asks you to find the way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more than 2 n 2 n operations.
A permutation of length n n is an array consisting of n n distinct integers from 1 1 to n n in arbitrary order. For example, [ 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 4 ] [ 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 4 ] is a permutation, but [ 1 , 2 , 2 ] [ 1 , 2 , 2 ] is not a permutation ( 2 2 appears twice in the array), and [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] is also not a permutation ( n = 3 n = 3 but there is 4 4 in the array).
