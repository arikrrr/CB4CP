One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose, the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks and a huge number of shells for launching.
Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation launches fireworks every a a minutes (i.e., after a , 2 ⋅ a , 3 ⋅ a , … a , 2 ⋅ a , 3 ⋅ a , … minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b b minutes (i.e., after b , 2 ⋅ b , 3 ⋅ b , … b , 2 ⋅ b , 3 ⋅ b , … minutes after launch).
Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a firework was launched after x x minutes after the installations were turned on, it will be visible every minute from x x to x + m x + m , inclusive. If one firework was launched m m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one minute.
What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time?
