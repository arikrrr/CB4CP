This is the easy version of a problem. The only difference between an easy and a hard version is the constraints on t t and n n . You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.
Arthur is giving a lesson to his famous 2 n 2 n knights. Like any other students, they're sitting at the desks in pairs, but out of habit in a circle. The knight 2 i − 1 2 i − 1 is sitting at the desk with the knight 2 i 2 i .
Each knight has intelligence , which can be measured by an integer. Let's denote the intelligence of the i i -th knight as a i a i . Arthur wants the maximal difference in total intelligence over all pairs of desks to be as small as possible. More formally, he wants to minimize max 1 ≤ i ≤ n ( a 2 i − 1 + a 2 i ) − min 1 ≤ i ≤ n ( a 2 i − 1 + a 2 i ) max 1 ≤ i ≤ n ( a 2 i − 1 + a 2 i ) − min 1 ≤ i ≤ n ( a 2 i − 1 + a 2 i ) .
However, the Code of Chivalry only allows swapping the opposite knights in the circle, i.e., Arthur can simultaneously perform a i : = a i + n a i := a i + n , a i + n : = a i a i + n := a i for any 1 ≤ i ≤ n 1 ≤ i ≤ n . Arthur can make any number of such swaps. What is the best result he can achieve?
