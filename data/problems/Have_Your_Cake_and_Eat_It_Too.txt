Alice, Bob and Charlie want to share a rectangular cake cut into n n pieces. Each person considers every piece to be worth a different value. The i i -th piece is considered to be of value a i a i by Alice, b i b i by Bob and c i c i by Charlie.
The sum over all a i a i , all b i b i and all c i c i individually is the same, equal to t o t t o t .
Given the values of each piece of the cake for each person, you need to give each person a contiguous slice of cake. In other words, the indices at the left and right ends of these subarrays (the slices given to each person) can be represented as ( l a , r a ) ( l a , r a ) , ( l b , r b ) ( l b , r b ) and ( l c , r c ) ( l c , r c ) respectively for Alice, Bob and Charlie. The division needs to satisfy the following constraints:
Here, the notation ⌈ a b ⌉ ⌈ a b ⌉ represents ceiling division. It is defined as the smallest integer greater than or equal to the exact division of a a by b b . In other words, it rounds up the division result to the nearest integer. For instance ⌈ 10 3 ⌉ = 4 ⌈ 10 3 ⌉ = 4 and ⌈ 15 3 ⌉ = 5 ⌈ 15 3 ⌉ = 5 .
