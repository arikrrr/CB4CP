There are m m baskets placed along a circle, numbered from 1 1 to m m in clockwise order (basket m m is next to basket 1 1 ). Furthermore, there are n n balls, where ball i i is initially placed in basket a i a i , and no basket contains more than one ball.
Alice is allowed to perform the following operation, which always takes exactly one second whether you move/throw a ball or not:
She repeats this operation until there is exactly one ball left. Calculate the expected time needed (in seconds) for Alice to end the process.
It can be proven that the answer can be represented as a rational number p q p q with coprime p p and q q . You need to output p ⋅ q − 1 mod 10 9 + 7 p ⋅ q − 1 mod 10 9 + 7 . It can be proven that 10 9 + 7 ∤ q 10 9 + 7 ∤ q .
