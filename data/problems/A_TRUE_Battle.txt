Alice and Bob are playing a game. There is a list of n n booleans, each of which is either true or false , given as a binary string ∗ ∗ of length n n (where 1 1 represents true , and 0 0 represents false ). Initially, there are no operators between the booleans.

Alice and Bob will take alternate turns placing and or or between the booleans, with Alice going first. Thus, the game will consist of n − 1 n − 1 turns since there are n n booleans. Alice aims for the final statement to evaluate to true , while Bob aims for it to evaluate to false . Given the list of boolean values, determine whether Alice will win if both players play optimally.

To evaluate the final expression, repeatedly perform the following steps until the statement consists of a single true or false :

∗ ∗ A binary string is a string that only consists of characters 0 0 and 1 1
