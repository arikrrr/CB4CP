You want to plant trees in a square lawn of size n × n n × n whose corners have Cartesian coordinates ( 0 , 0 ) ( 0 , 0 ) , ( n , 0 ) ( n , 0 ) , ( 0 , n ) ( 0 , n ) , and ( n , n ) ( n , n ) . Trees can only be planted at locations with integer coordinates. Every tree will grow roots within a disk of radius r r centered at the location where the tree was planted; such disks must be fully contained in the lawn (possibly touching the boundary of the lawn) and can only intersect each other on their boundaries.
Find a configuration that maximizes the number of trees.
