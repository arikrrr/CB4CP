Jellyfish is playing a one-player card game called "Slay the Spire". There are n n cards in total numbered from 1 1 to n n . The i i -th card has power c i c i .
There is a binary string s s of length n n . If s i = 0 s i = 0 , the i i -th card is initially in the draw pile. If s i = 1 s i = 1 , the i i -th card is initially in Jellyfish's hand.
Jellyfish will repeat the following process until either her hand or the draw pile is empty.
At the end of this process, find the probability that Jellyfish can empty the draw pile, modulo 1 000 000 007 1 000 000 007 .
Formally, let M = 1 000 000 007 M = 1 000 000 007 . It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction p q p q , where p p and q q are integers and q ≢ 0 ( mod M ) q ≢ 0 ( mod M ) . Output the integer equal to p ⋅ q − 1 mod M p ⋅ q − 1 mod M . In other words, output such an integer x x that 0 ≤ x < M 0 ≤ x < M and x ⋅ q ≡ p ( mod M ) x ⋅ q ≡ p ( mod M ) .
