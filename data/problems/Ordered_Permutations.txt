Consider a permutation ∗ ∗ p 1 , p 2 , … , p n p 1 , p 2 , … , p n of integers from 1 1 to n n . We can introduce the following sum for it † † :



Let us consider all permutations of length n n with the maximum possible value of S ( p ) S ( p ) . Output the k k -th of them in lexicographical ‡ ‡ order, or report that there are less than k k of them.

∗ ∗ A permutation of length n n is an array consisting of n n distinct integers from 1 1 to n n in arbitrary order. For example, [ 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 4 ] [ 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 4 ] is a permutation, but [ 1 , 2 , 2 ] [ 1 , 2 , 2 ] is not a permutation ( 2 2 appears twice in the array), and [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] is also not a permutation ( n = 3 n = 3 but there is 4 4 in the array).

† † For example:

‡ ‡ An array a a is lexicographically smaller than an array b b if and only if one of the following holds:
