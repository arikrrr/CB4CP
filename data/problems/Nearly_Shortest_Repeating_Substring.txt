You are given a string s s of length n n consisting of lowercase Latin characters. Find the length of the shortest string k k such that several (possibly one) copies of k k can be concatenated together to form a string with the same length as s s and, at most, one different character.
More formally, find the length of the shortest string k k such that c = k + ⋯ + k            x times c = k + ⋯ + k ⏟ x times for some positive integer x x , strings s s and c c has the same length and c i ≠ s i c i ≠ s i for at most one i i (i.e. there exist 0 0 or 1 1 such positions).
