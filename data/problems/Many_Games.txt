Recently, you received a rare ticket to the only casino in the world where you can actually earn something, and you want to take full advantage of this opportunity.

The conditions in this casino are as follows:

You need to choose a set of games in advance that you will play in such a way as to maximize the expected value of your winnings.

In this case, if you choose to play the games with indices i 1 < i 2 < … < i k i 1 < i 2 < … < i k , you will win in all of them with a probability of ∏ j = 1 k p i j 100 ∏ j = 1 k p i j 100 , and in that case, your winnings will be equal to ∑ j = 1 k w i j ∑ j = 1 k w i j .

That is, the expected value of your winnings will be ( ∏ j = 1 k p i j 100 ) ⋅ ( ∑ j = 1 k w i j ) ( ∏ j = 1 k p i j 100 ) ⋅ ( ∑ j = 1 k w i j ) .

To avoid going bankrupt, the casino owners have limited the expected value of winnings for each individual game. Thus, for all i i ( 1 ≤ i ≤ n 1 ≤ i ≤ n ), it holds that w i ⋅ p i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10 5 w i ⋅ p i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10 5 .

Your task is to find the maximum expected value of winnings that can be obtained by choosing some set of games in the casino.
