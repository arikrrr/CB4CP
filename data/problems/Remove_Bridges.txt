You are given a rooted tree, consisting of n n vertices, numbered from 1 1 to n n . Vertex 1 1 is the root. Additionally, the root only has one child.
You are asked to add exactly k k edges to the tree (possibly, multiple edges and/or edges already existing in the tree).
Recall that a bridge is such an edge that, after you remove it, the number of connected components in the graph increases. So, initially, all edges of the tree are bridges.
After k k edges are added, some original edges of the tree are still bridges and some are not anymore. You want to satisfy two conditions:
Solve the task for all values of k k from 1 1 to n − 1 n − 1 and output the smallest number of bridges.
