Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a 1 , a 2 , … , a k a 1 , a 2 , … , a k .
In this game, initially n n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds of this game, the following happens:
Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are still in the game are declared as winners.
For example, consider the game with a = [ 3 , 5 ] a = [ 3 , 5 ] and n = 5 n = 5 players. Let the players be named player A , player B , … … , player E in the order they are lined up initially. Then,
Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene gave you q q integers n 1 , n 2 , … , n q n 1 , n 2 , … , n q and you should answer the following question for each 1 ≤ i ≤ q 1 ≤ i ≤ q independently :
