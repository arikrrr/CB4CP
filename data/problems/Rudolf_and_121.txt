Rudolf has an array a a of n n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 1 to n n .
In one operation, he can choose an index i i ( 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 ) and assign:
Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i i can be used zero or more times.
Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?
