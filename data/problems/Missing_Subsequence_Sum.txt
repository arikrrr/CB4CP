You are given two integers n n and k k . Find a sequence a a of non-negative integers of size at most 25 25 such that the following conditions hold.
A sequence b b is a subsequence of a a if b b can be obtained from a a by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [ 5 , 2 , 3 ] [ 5 , 2 , 3 ] is a subsequence of [ 1 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 2 , 4 , 3 ] [ 1 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 2 , 4 , 3 ] .
It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.
