You are given n n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be tangent to each other.
Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the disks in such a way that:
