Mualani loves surfing on her sharky surfboard!

Mualani's surf path can be modeled by a number line. She starts at position 1 1 , and the path ends at position L L . When she is at position x x with a jump power of k k , she can jump to any integer position in the interval [ x , x + k ] [ x , x + k ] . Initially, her jump power is 1 1 .

However, her surf path isn't completely smooth. There are n n hurdles on her path. Each hurdle is represented by an interval [ l , r ] [ l , r ] , meaning she cannot jump to any position in the interval [ l , r ] [ l , r ] .

There are also m m power-ups at certain positions on the path. Power-up i i is located at position x i x i and has a value of v i v i . When Mualani is at position x i x i , she has the option to collect the power-up to increase her jump power by v i v i . There may be multiple power-ups at the same position. When she is at a position with some power-ups, she may choose to take or ignore each individual power-up. No power-up is in the interval of any hurdle.

What is the minimum number of power-ups she must collect to reach position L L to finish the path? If it is not possible to finish the surf path, output − 1 − 1 .
