Vladislav has a playlist consisting of n n songs, numbered from 1 1 to n n . Song i i has genre g i g i and writer w i w i . He wants to make a playlist in such a way that every pair of adjacent songs either have the same writer or are from the same genre (or both). He calls such a playlist exciting . Both g i g i and w i w i are strings of length no more than 10 4 10 4 .
It might not always be possible to make an exciting playlist using all the songs, so the shuffling process occurs in two steps. First, some amount (possibly zero) of the songs are removed, and then the remaining songs in the playlist are rearranged to make it exciting.
Since Vladislav doesn't like when songs get removed from his playlist, he wants the making playlist to perform as few removals as possible. Help him find the minimum number of removals that need to be performed in order to be able to rearrange the rest of the songs to make the playlist exciting.
