Monocarp plays a fantasy RPG. His character is a mage, so he casts spells. There are two types of spells he knows â€” basic spells and composite spells.
There are n n basic spells in Monocarp's spell book, numbered from 1 1 to n n . Each basic spell simply changes the health of the target: either decreases it or increases it. The i i -th basic spell changes the target's health value by b i b i (increases by b i b i if b i b i is non-negative, or decreases by | b i | | b i | if b i b i is negative). If the target's health value goes to 0 0 or below, it dies, and all next spells cast at it do nothing.
There are also m m composite spells in the spell book, numbered from n + 1 n + 1 to n + m n + m . Each composite spell is a sequence of other spells, cast in specific order. A composite spell can consist both of basic spells and composite spells; the i i -th spell consists of s i s i other spells, and each of those spells has index strictly less than i i (so there is no situation that composite spells infinitely cast each other). So, actually, each composite spell can be considered a finite sequence of basic spells, although its length might be huge. Note that the same spell can appear in a composite spell multiple times.
Monocarp has decided to cast the ( n + m ) ( n + m ) -th spell from his spell book. The target of this spell is a monster with an initial health value of h p h p . Monocarp wants to know whether the monster will be killed or not, and if it will be killed, which basic spell will kill it.
