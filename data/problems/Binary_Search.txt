Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.
You are given a permutation p p of size n n , and a number x x that needs to be found. A permutation of length n n is an array consisting of n n distinct integers from 1 1 to n n in arbitrary order. For example, [ 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 4 ] [ 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 4 ] is a permutation, but [ 1 , 2 , 2 ] [ 1 , 2 , 2 ] is not a permutation ( 2 2 appears twice in the array), and [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] is also not a permutation ( n = 3 n = 3 but there is 4 4 in the array).
You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary search, the array must be sorted.
You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more than 2 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i i , j j ( 1 ≤ i , j ≤ n 1 ≤ i , j ≤ n ) and swap the elements at positions i i and j j .
After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm, two variables l = 1 l = 1 and r = n + 1 r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is executed:
The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, p l p l is equal to x x . It can be shown that 2 2 operations are always sufficient.
