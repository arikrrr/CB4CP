You are given two integer arrays: array a a of length n n and array b b of length n + 1 n + 1 .
You can perform the following operations any number of times in any order:
Your task is to calculate the minimum number of aforementioned operations (possibly zero) required to transform the array a a into the array b b . It can be shown that under the constraints of the problem, it is always possible.
