Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the users pick strong passwords.
Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following conditions:
Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.
Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?
