Farmer John has a permutation p 1 , p 2 , … , p n p 1 , p 2 , … , p n , where every integer from 0 0 to n − 1 n − 1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a a of length n n and challenges her to construct p p based on a a .
The array a a is constructed so that a i a i = MEX ( p 1 , p 2 , … , p i ) − p i MEX ( p 1 , p 2 , … , p i ) − p i , where the MEX MEX of an array is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in that array. For example, MEX ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) = 0 MEX ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) = 0 and MEX ( 3 , 1 , 0 ) = 2 MEX ( 3 , 1 , 0 ) = 2 .
Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p p that satisfies a a . The input is given in such a way that at least one valid p p exists. If there are multiple possible p p , it is enough to print one of them.
