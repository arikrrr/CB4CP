There are n n lamps numbered 1 1 to n n lined up in a row, initially turned off. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
Determine whether you can reach configuration s s , where s i = 1 s i = 1 means the i i -th lamp is turned on, and s i = 0 s i = 0 otherwise.
† † Only lamp i i and i + 1 i + 1 are adjacent for all 1 ≤ i < n 1 ≤ i < n . Note that lamp n n and 1 1 are not adjacent when n ≠ 2 n ≠ 2 .
