A newly discovered organism can be represented as a set of cells on an infinite grid. There is a coordinate system on the grid such that each cell has two integer coordinates x x and y y . A cell with coordinates x = a x = a and y = b y = b will be denoted as ( a , b ) ( a , b ) .
Initially, the organism consists of a single cell ( 0 , 0 ) ( 0 , 0 ) . Then zero or more divisions can happen. In one division, a cell ( a , b ) ( a , b ) is removed and replaced by two cells ( a + 1 , b ) ( a + 1 , b ) and ( a , b + 1 ) ( a , b + 1 ) .
For example, after the first division, the organism always consists of two cells ( 1 , 0 ) ( 1 , 0 ) and ( 0 , 1 ) ( 0 , 1 ) , and after the second division, it is either the three cells ( 2 , 0 ) ( 2 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 1 ) ( 1 , 1 ) and ( 0 , 1 ) ( 0 , 1 ) , or the three cells ( 1 , 0 ) ( 1 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 1 ) ( 1 , 1 ) and ( 0 , 2 ) ( 0 , 2 ) .
A division of a cell ( a , b ) ( a , b ) can only happen if the cells ( a + 1 , b ) ( a + 1 , b ) and ( a , b + 1 ) ( a , b + 1 ) are not yet part of the organism. For example, the cell ( 1 , 0 ) ( 1 , 0 ) cannot divide if the organism currently consists of the three cells ( 1 , 0 ) ( 1 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 1 ) ( 1 , 1 ) and ( 0 , 2 ) ( 0 , 2 ) , since the cell ( 1 , 1 ) ( 1 , 1 ) that would be one of the results of this division is already part of the organism.
You are given a set of forbidden cells ( c i , d i ) ( c i , d i ) . Is it possible for the organism to contain none of those cells after zero or more divisions?
