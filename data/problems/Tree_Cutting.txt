You are given a tree with n n vertices.
Your task is to find the maximum number x x such that it is possible to remove exactly k k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component † † is at least x x .
† † Two vertices v v and u u are in the same connected component if there exists a sequence of numbers t 1 , t 2 , … , t k t 1 , t 2 , … , t k of arbitrary length k k , such that t 1 = v t 1 = v , t k = u t k = u , and for each i i from 1 1 to k − 1 k − 1 , vertices t i t i and t i + 1 t i + 1 are connected by an edge.
