You are given a cycle with n n vertices numbered from 0 0 to n − 1 n − 1 . For each 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 , there is an undirected edge between vertex i i and vertex ( ( i + 1 ) mod n ) ( ( i + 1 ) mod n ) with the color c i c i ( c i = R c i = R or B B ).

Determine whether the following condition holds for every pair of vertices ( i , j ) ( i , j ) ( 0 ≤ i < j ≤ n − 1 0 ≤ i < j ≤ n − 1 ):
