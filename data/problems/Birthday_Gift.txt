Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a a of length n n .
Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a favorite number x x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k k such that it is possible to select pairs of numbers [ l 1 , r 1 l 1 , r 1 ], [ l 2 , r 2 l 2 , r 2 ], … … [ l k , r k l k , r k ], such that:
If such k k does not exist, then output − 1 − 1 .
