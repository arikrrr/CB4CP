Superultra, a little red panda, desperately wants primogems. In his dreams, a voice tells him that he must solve the following task to obtain a lifetime supply of primogems. Help Superultra!

Construct a permutation ∗ ∗ p p of length n n such that p i + p i + 1 p i + p i + 1 is composite † † over all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 . If it's not possible, output − 1 − 1 .

∗ ∗ A permutation of length n n is an array consisting of n n distinct integers from 1 1 to n n in arbitrary order. For example, [ 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 4 ] [ 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 4 ] is a permutation, but [ 1 , 2 , 2 ] [ 1 , 2 , 2 ] is not a permutation ( 2 2 appears twice in the array), and [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] is also not a permutation ( n = 3 n = 3 but there is 4 4 in the array).

† † An integer x x is composite if it has at least one other divisor besides 1 1 and x x . For example, 4 4 is composite because 2 2 is a divisor.
