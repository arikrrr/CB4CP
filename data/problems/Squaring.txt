ikrpprpp found an array a a consisting of integers. He likes justice, so he wants to make a a fair — that is, make it non-decreasing. To do that, he can perform an act of justice on an index 1 ≤ i ≤ n 1 ≤ i ≤ n of the array, which will replace a i a i with a 2 i a i 2 (the element at position i i with its square). For example, if a = [ 2 , 4 , 3 , 3 , 5 , 3 ] a = [ 2 , 4 , 3 , 3 , 5 , 3 ] and ikrpprpp chooses to perform an act of justice on i = 4 i = 4 , a a becomes [ 2 , 4 , 3 , 9 , 5 , 3 ] [ 2 , 4 , 3 , 9 , 5 , 3 ] .
What is the minimum number of acts of justice needed to make the array non-decreasing?
