You have been given a matrix a a of size n n by m m , containing a permutation of integers from 1 1 to n ⋅ m n ⋅ m .
A permutation of n n integers is an array containing all numbers from 1 1 to n n exactly once. For example, the arrays [ 1 ] [ 1 ] , [ 2 , 1 , 3 ] [ 2 , 1 , 3 ] , [ 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ] [ 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 ] are permutations, while the arrays [ 1 , 1 ] [ 1 , 1 ] , [ 100 ] [ 100 ] , [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ] [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ] are not.
A matrix contains a permutation if, when all its elements are written out, the resulting array is a permutation. Matrices [ [ 1 , 2 ] , [ 3 , 4 ] ] [ [ 1 , 2 ] , [ 3 , 4 ] ] , [ [ 1 ] ] [ [ 1 ] ] , [ [ 1 , 5 , 3 ] , [ 2 , 6 , 4 ] ] [ [ 1 , 5 , 3 ] , [ 2 , 6 , 4 ] ] contain permutations, while matrices [ [ 2 ] ] [ [ 2 ] ] , [ [ 1 , 1 ] , [ 2 , 2 ] ] [ [ 1 , 1 ] , [ 2 , 2 ] ] , [ [ 1 , 2 ] , [ 100 , 200 ] ] [ [ 1 , 2 ] , [ 100 , 200 ] ] do not.
