Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a a consisting of n n positive integers as a gift.
Now Mocha wants to know whether array a a could become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:
For example, if a = [ 3 , 1 , 4 , 1 , 5 ] a = [ 3 , 1 , 4 , 1 , 5 ] , we can choose x = [ 3 , 1 ] x = [ 3 , 1 ] and y = [ 4 , 1 , 5 ] y = [ 4 , 1 , 5 ] , satisfying a = x + y a = x + y . Then, we can set a : = y + x = [ 4 , 1 , 5 , 3 , 1 ] a := y + x = [ 4 , 1 , 5 , 3 , 1 ] . We can also choose x = [ 3 , 1 , 4 , 1 , 5 ] x = [ 3 , 1 , 4 , 1 , 5 ] and y = [ ] y = [ ] , satisfying a = x + y a = x + y . Then, we can set a : = y + x = [ 3 , 1 , 4 , 1 , 5 ] a := y + x = [ 3 , 1 , 4 , 1 , 5 ] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x = [ 3 , 1 , 1 ] x = [ 3 , 1 , 1 ] and y = [ 4 , 5 ] y = [ 4 , 5 ] , neither are we allowed to choose x = [ 1 , 3 ] x = [ 1 , 3 ] and y = [ 5 , 1 , 4 ] y = [ 5 , 1 , 4 ] , as both these choices do not satisfy a = x + y a = x + y .
