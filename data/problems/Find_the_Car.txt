Timur is in a car traveling on the number line from point 0 0 to point n n . The car starts moving from point 0 0 at minute 0 0 .
There are k + 1 k + 1 signs on the line at points 0 , a 1 , a 2 , … , a k 0 , a 1 , a 2 , … , a k , and Timur knows that the car will arrive there at minutes 0 , b 1 , b 2 , … , b k 0 , b 1 , b 2 , … , b k , respectively. The sequences a a and b b are strictly increasing with a k = n a k = n .
Between any two adjacent signs, the car travels with a constant speed . Timur has q q queries: each query will be an integer d d , and Timur wants you to output how many minutes it takes the car to reach point d d , rounded down to the nearest integer .
