The Manhattan distance between two points ( x 1 , y 1 ) ( x 1 , y 1 ) and ( x 2 , y 2 ) ( x 2 , y 2 ) is defined as:
We call a Manhattan triangle three points on the plane, the Manhattan distances between each pair of which are equal.
You are given a set of pairwise distinct points and an even integer d d . Your task is to find any Manhattan triangle, composed of three distinct points from the given set, where the Manhattan distance between any pair of vertices is equal to d d .
