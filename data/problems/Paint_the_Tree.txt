378QAQ has a tree with n n vertices. Initially, all vertices are white.
There are two chess pieces called P A P A and P B P B on the tree. P A P A and P B P B are initially located on vertices a a and b b respectively. In one step, 378QAQ will do the following in order:
Initially, the vertex a a is painted red. If a = b a = b , the vertex a a is painted blue instead. Note that both the chess pieces must be moved in each step. Two pieces can be on the same vertex at any given time.
378QAQ wants to know the minimum number of steps to paint all vertices blue.
