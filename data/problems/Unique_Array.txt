You are given an integer array a a of length n n . A subarray of a a is one of its contiguous subsequences (i. e. an array [ a l , a l + 1 , … , a r ] [ a l , a l + 1 , … , a r ] for some integers l l and r r such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n ). Let's call a subarray unique if there is an integer that occurs exactly once in the subarray.
You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): choose an element of the array and replace it with any integer.
Your task is to calculate the minimum number of aforementioned operation in order for all the subarrays of the array a a to be unique.
