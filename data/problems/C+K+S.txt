You are given two strongly connected † † directed graphs, each with exactly n n vertices, but possibly different numbers of edges. Upon closer inspection, you noticed an important feature — the length of any cycle in these graphs is divisible by k k .

Each of the 2 n 2 n vertices belongs to exactly one of two types: incoming or outgoing . For each vertex, its type is known to you.

You need to determine whether it is possible to draw exactly n n directed edges between the source graphs such that the following four conditions are met:

† † A strongly connected graph is a graph in which there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex.
