Today, Cat and Fox found an array a a consisting of n n non-negative integers.
Define the loneliness of a a as the smallest positive integer k k ( 1 ≤ k ≤ n 1 ≤ k ≤ n ) such that for any two positive integers i i and j j ( 1 ≤ i , j ≤ n − k + 1 1 ≤ i , j ≤ n − k + 1 ), the following holds:
Cat and Fox want to know how lonely the array a a is. Help them calculate the loneliness of the found array.
