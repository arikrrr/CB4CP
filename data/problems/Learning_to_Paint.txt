Elsie is learning how to paint. She has a canvas of n n cells numbered from 1 1 to n n and can paint any (potentially empty) subset of cells.
Elsie has a 2D array a a which she will use to evaluate paintings. Let the maximal contiguous intervals of painted cells in a painting be [ l 1 , r 1 ] , [ l 2 , r 2 ] , … , [ l x , r x ] [ l 1 , r 1 ] , [ l 2 , r 2 ] , … , [ l x , r x ] . The beauty of the painting is the sum of a l i , r i a l i , r i over all 1 ≤ i ≤ x 1 ≤ i ≤ x . In the image above, the maximal contiguous intervals of painted cells are [ 2 , 4 ] , [ 6 , 6 ] , [ 8 , 9 ] [ 2 , 4 ] , [ 6 , 6 ] , [ 8 , 9 ] and the beauty of the painting is a 2 , 4 + a 6 , 6 + a 8 , 9 a 2 , 4 + a 6 , 6 + a 8 , 9 .
There are 2 n 2 n ways to paint the strip. Help Elsie find the k k largest possible values of the beauty of a painting she can obtain, among all these ways. Note that these k k values do not necessarily have to be distinct. It is guaranteed that there are at least k k different ways to paint the canvas.
