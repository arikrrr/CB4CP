Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his friend solve this problem.
The river is a grid of n n rows and m m columns. The intersection of the i i -th row and the j j -th column contains the number a i , j a i , j — the depth in the corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the river banks, so the depth for them is 0 0 .
Rudolf can choose the row ( i , 1 ) , ( i , 2 ) , … , ( i , m ) ( i , 1 ) , ( i , 2 ) , … , ( i , m ) and build a bridge over it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost of installing a support in the cell ( i , j ) ( i , j ) is a i , j + 1 a i , j + 1 . Supports must be installed so that the following conditions are met:
Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k k bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i i ( 1 ≤ i ≤ n − k + 1 1 ≤ i ≤ n − k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i , i + 1 , … , i + k − 1 i , i + 1 , … , i + k − 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing supports.
