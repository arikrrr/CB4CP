You have obtained the new limited event character Xilonen. You decide to use her in combat.

There are n n enemies in a line. The i i 'th enemy from the left has health h i h i and is currently at position x i x i . Xilonen has an attack damage of m m , and you are ready to defeat the enemies with her.

Xilonen has a powerful "ground stomp" attack. Before you perform any attacks , you select an integer p p and position Xilonen there ( p p can be any integer position, including a position with an enemy currently). Afterwards, for each attack, she deals m m damage to an enemy at position p p (if there are any), m − 1 m − 1 damage to enemies at positions p − 1 p − 1 and p + 1 p + 1 , m − 2 m − 2 damage to enemies at positions p − 2 p − 2 and p + 2 p + 2 , and so on. Enemies that are at least a distance of m m away from Xilonen take no damage from attacks.

Formally, if there is an enemy at position x x , she will deal max ( 0 , m − | p − x | ) max ( 0 , m − | p − x | ) damage to that enemy each hit. Note that you may not choose a different p p for different attacks.

Over all possible p p , output the minimum number of attacks Xilonen must perform to defeat at least k k enemies. If it is impossible to find a p p such that eventually at least k k enemies will be defeated, output − 1 − 1 instead. Note that an enemy is considered to be defeated if its health reaches 0 0 or below.
