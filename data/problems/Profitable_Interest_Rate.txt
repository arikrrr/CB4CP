Alice has a a coins. She can open a bank deposit called "Profitable", but the minimum amount required to open this deposit is b b coins.

There is also a deposit called "Unprofitable", which can be opened with any amount of coins. Alice noticed that if she opens the "Unprofitable" deposit with x x coins, the minimum amount required to open the "Profitable" deposit decreases by 2 x 2 x coins. However, these coins cannot later be deposited into the "Profitable" deposit.

Help Alice determine the maximum number of coins she can deposit into the "Profitable" deposit if she first deposits some amount of coins (possibly 0 0 ) into the "Unprofitable" deposit. If Alice can never open the "Profitable" deposit, output 0 0 .
