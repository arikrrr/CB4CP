You are given an integer n n .
Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be exactly n n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
For example, there are 6 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at positions: 1 1 , 3 3 , 5 5 , 6 6 , 7 7 and 8 8 ).
Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.
