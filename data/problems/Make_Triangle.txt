You are given n n positive integers x 1 , x 2 , … , x n x 1 , x 2 , … , x n and three positive integers n a , n b , n c n a , n b , n c satisfying n a + n b + n c = n n a + n b + n c = n .
You want to split the n n positive integers into three groups, so that:
Determine if this is possible. If this is possible, find one way to do so.
