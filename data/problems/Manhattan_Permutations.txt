Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation † † p p the value of the expression | p 1 − 1 | + | p 2 − 2 | + … + | p n − n | | p 1 − 1 | + | p 2 − 2 | + … + | p n − n | .
For example, for the permutation [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , the Manhattan value is | 1 − 1 | + | 2 − 2 | + | 3 − 3 | = 0 | 1 − 1 | + | 2 − 2 | + | 3 − 3 | = 0 , and for the permutation [ 3 , 1 , 2 ] [ 3 , 1 , 2 ] , the Manhattan value is | 3 − 1 | + | 1 − 2 | + | 2 − 3 | = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 | 3 − 1 | + | 1 − 2 | + | 2 − 3 | = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .
You are given integers n n and k k . Find a permutation p p of length n n such that its Manhattan value is equal to k k , or determine that no such permutation exists.
† † A permutation of length n n is an array consisting of n n distinct integers from 1 1 to n n in arbitrary order. For example, [ 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 4 ] [ 2 , 3 , 1 , 5 , 4 ] is a permutation, but [ 1 , 2 , 2 ] [ 1 , 2 , 2 ] is not a permutation ( 2 2 appears twice in the array), and [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] is also not a permutation ( n = 3 n = 3 but there is 4 4 in the array).
