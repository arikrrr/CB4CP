Sasha has two binary strings s s and t t of the same length n n , consisting of the characters 0 and 1 .
There is also a computing machine that can perform two types of operations on binary strings a a and b b of the same length k k :
Sasha became interested in the following: if we consider the string a = s l s l + 1 … s r a = s l s l + 1 … s r and the string b = t l t l + 1 … t r b = t l t l + 1 … t r , what is the maximum number of 1 characters in the string a a that can be obtained using the computing machine. Since Sasha is very curious but lazy, it is up to you to answer this question for several pairs ( l i , r i ) ( l i , r i ) that interest him.
