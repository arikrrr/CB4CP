Vitaly503 is given a checkered board with a side of n n and k k chips. He realized that all these k k chips need to be placed on the cells of the board (no more than one chip can be placed on a single cell).
Let's denote the cell in the i i -th row and j j -th column as ( i , j ) ( i , j ) . A diagonal is the set of cells for which the value i + j i + j is the same. For example, cells ( 3 , 1 ) ( 3 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 2 ) ( 2 , 2 ) , and ( 1 , 3 ) ( 1 , 3 ) lie on the same diagonal, but ( 1 , 2 ) ( 1 , 2 ) and ( 2 , 3 ) ( 2 , 3 ) do not. A diagonal is called occupied if it contains at least one chip.
Determine what is the minimum possible number of occupied diagonals among all placements of k k chips.
