Bessie has recently started playing a famous card game. In the game, there is only one deck of cards, consisting of a a "draw 0 0 " cards, b b "draw 1 1 " cards, c c "draw 2 2 " cards, and 5 5 special cards. At the start of the game, all cards are in the randomly shuffled deck.
Bessie starts the game by drawing the top 5 5 cards of the deck. She may then play "draw x x " cards from the hand to draw the next x x cards from the top of the deck. Note that every card can only be played once, special cards cannot be played, and if Bessie uses a "draw 2 2 " card when there is only 1 1 card remaining in the deck, then she simply draws that remaining card. Bessie wins if she draws all 5 5 special cards.
Since Bessie is not very good at math problems, she wants you to find the probability that she wins, given that the deck is shuffled randomly over all ( a + b + c + 5 ) ! ( a + b + c + 5 ) ! possible orderings. It can be shown that this answer can always be expressed as a fraction p q p q where p p and q q are coprime integers. Output p ⋅ q − 1 p ⋅ q − 1 modulo 998 244 353 998 244 353 .
