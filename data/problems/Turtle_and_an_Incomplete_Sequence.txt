Turtle was playing with a sequence a 1 , a 2 , … , a n a 1 , a 2 , … , a n consisting of positive integers. Unfortunately, some of the integers went missing while playing.
Now the sequence becomes incomplete. There may exist an arbitrary number of indices i i such that a i a i becomes − 1 − 1 . Let the new sequence be a ′ a ′ .
Turtle is sad. But Turtle remembers that for every integer i i from 1 1 to n − 1 n − 1 , either a i = ⌊ a i + 1 2 ⌋ a i = ⌊ a i + 1 2 ⌋ or a i + 1 = ⌊ a i 2 ⌋ a i + 1 = ⌊ a i 2 ⌋ holds for the original sequence a a .
Turtle wants you to help him complete the sequence. But sometimes Turtle makes mistakes, so you need to tell him if you can't complete the sequence.
Formally, you need to find another sequence b 1 , b 2 , … , b n b 1 , b 2 , … , b n consisting of positive integers such that:
If there is no sequence b 1 , b 2 , … , b n b 1 , b 2 , … , b n that satisfies all of the conditions above, you need to report − 1 − 1 .
