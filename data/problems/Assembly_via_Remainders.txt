You are given an array x 2 , x 3 , … , x n x 2 , x 3 , … , x n . Your task is to find any array a 1 , … , a n a 1 , … , a n , where:
Here c mod d c mod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c c by the integer d d . For example 5 mod 2 = 1 5 mod 2 = 1 , 72 mod 3 = 0 72 mod 3 = 0 , 143 mod 14 = 3 143 mod 14 = 3 .
Note that if there is more than one a a which satisfies the statement, you are allowed to find any.
