You are given a binary string s s of length n n , consisting of zeros and ones. You can perform the following operation exactly once :
For example, if you apply the operation to the string 110001100110 with p = 3 p = 3 , after the second step, the string will become 011 001100110 , and after the third step, it will become 001100110 011 .
A string s s is called k k -proper if two conditions are met:
For example, with k = 3 k = 3 , the strings 000 , 111000111 , and 111000 are k k -proper, while the strings 000000 , 001100 , and 1110000 are not.
You are given an integer k k , which is a divisor of n n . Find an integer p p ( 1 ≤ p ≤ n 1 ≤ p ≤ n ) such that after performing the operation, the string s s becomes k k -proper, or determine that it is impossible. Note that if the string is initially k k -proper, you still need to apply exactly one operation to it.
