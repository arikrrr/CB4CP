There is an array a a consisting of n n integers. Initially, all elements of a a are equal to 0 0 .

Kevin can perform several operations on the array. Each operation is one of the following two types:

In the country of KDOI, people think that the integer v v is balanced. Thus, Iris gives Kevin an array c c consisting of n n integers and defines the beauty of the array a a as follows:

Kevin wants to maximize the beauty of a a after all the operations. However, he had already performed m m operations when he was sleepy. Now, he can perform an arbitrary number (possibly zero) of new operations.

You have to help Kevin find the maximum possible beauty if he optimally performs the new operations.

However, to make sure that you are not just rolling the dice, Kevin gives you an integer V V , and you need to solve the problem for each 1 ≤ v ≤ V 1 ≤ v ≤ V .
