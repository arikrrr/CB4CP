Harry Potter is hiking in the Alps surrounding Lake Geneva. In this area there are m m cabins, numbered 1 to m m . Each cabin is connected, with one or more trails, to a central meeting point next to the lake. Each trail is either short or long . Cabin i i is connected with s i s i short trails and l i l i long trails to the lake.
Each day, Harry walks a trail from the cabin where he currently is to Lake Geneva, and then from there he walks a trail to any of the m m cabins (including the one he started in). However, as he has to finish the hike in a day, at least one of the two trails has to be short.
How many possible combinations of trails can Harry take if he starts in cabin 1 and walks for n n days?
Give the answer modulo 10 9 + 7 10 9 + 7 .
