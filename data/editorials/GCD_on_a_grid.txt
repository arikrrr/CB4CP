First, let's learn how to check for a fixed xx if there exists a path from (1,1)(1,1) to (n,m)(n,m) with a GCD of xx. It is necessary for all numbers along the path to be divisible by xx. Let's define a grid bb of size nn by mm, where bi,j=1bi,j=1 if ai,jai,j is divisible by xx, and bi,j=0bi,j=0 otherwise. If there exists a path of ones in bb, then there exists a path in aa with a GCD of xx.To check if there exists a path consisting entirely of ones, dynamic programming can be used. Let dpi,jdpi,j denote whether it is possible to reach (i,j)(i,j) from (1,1)(1,1). Then the transitions are dpi,j=dpi−1,j∨dpi,j−1dpi,j=dpi−1,j∨dpi,j−1, with the base case of the dynamic programming being dp1,1=b1,1dp1,1=b1,1.Since the path will definitely pass through the cells (1,1)(1,1) and (n,m)(n,m), we iterate through all divisors of the number g=gcd(a1,1,an,m)g=gcd(a1,1,an,m), check for each one if there exists a path with that GCD, and take the maximum such divisor. The complexity of the solution is O(n⋅m⋅A−−√3)O(n⋅m⋅A3), where A≤106A≤106.
