Note that one action with the cube changes the parity of the number of cubes in the tower. Therefore, if the parities of nn and mm do not match, it is impossible to build the tower. Also, if n<mn<m, the tower cannot be built either. In all other cases, it is possible to build a tower of height mm in mm operations, and then add and remove a cube until the operations are exhausted.First, let's understand why 2 colors are indeed sufficient.Notice that the reachability relation in a graph defines a Partially Ordered Set.According to Dilworth's Theorem, the size of the maximum antichain is equal to the minimum number of chains that cover the Partially Ordered Set.Note that the condition on the reachability of pairs of vertices within any triplet implies a constraint on the maximum size of the antichain. It is simply no more than 2. Therefore, 2 colors are indeed sufficient.The remaining task is to understand how to explicitly construct these 2 chains.We will build this inductively. Let's maintain 3 stacks — the last vertices painted in black, white, and red respectively. These will correspond to the chains we are building.Suppose we have built chains on nn vertices and want to build them on n+1n+1:If the white or black stacks are empty, simply add vertex n+1n+1 to the empty stack.If the red stack is empty:If the red stack is not empty:Each time a new vertex is added, no more than 2 queries are used. Therefore, we will use no more than 2⋅n2⋅n queries in total.During the algorithm, all operations are performed in O(1)O(1) time, resulting in an overall complexity of O(n)O(n).As an exercise for the reader, try to prove the lower bound on the number of queries.
