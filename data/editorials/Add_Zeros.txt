2027C - Add ZerosLet's rearrange the equation given in the statement to find a 'required'|a||a|value in order to use an operation at that index. We haveai=|a|+1−iai=|a|+1−i, so|a|=ai+i−1|a|=ai+i−1. Note that ifai=0ai=0, then the condition is never true, sincei−1<|a|i−1<|a|always. So actually, we just need to consider the firstnnpositions.Once we use an operation at positionii, the length of the array will increase byi−1i−1. So, for each position we require some lengthui=ai+i−1ui=ai+i−1and make a length ofvi=u+i−1vi=u+i−1. So, let's create a graph containing allnnedges, and run some DFS or BFS on this graph starting from nodenn(the starting value of|a||a|). It then follows that the largest node visited is the maximum length of the array we can possibly get.We should use a map to store the graph, since the length of the array can grow up to≈n2≈n2and so the graph is very sparse. If we don't want to use a map, we can also take advantage of the fact that all edges are directed fromuiuitoviviwhereui<viui<viand that all edges and nodes are fixed, so we can actually iterate through alluiuiand maintain a boolean array of whichvivivalues are visited so far, updating it at any point using a binary search.
