2028B - Alice's Adventures in PermutingSuppose thatb=0b=0. Then, ifc≥nc≥n, the answer isnn; ifc=n−1c=n−1orc=n−2c=n−2, the answer isn−1n−1; and otherwise, it is−1−1(for example, considerc=n−3c=n−3, in which case we will end up witha=[0,1,…,n−4,n−3,n−3,n−3]→[0,1,…,n−4,n−3,n−3,n−2]→[0,1,…,n−4,n−3,n−3,n−1]a=[0,1,…,n−4,n−3,n−3,n−3]→[0,1,…,n−4,n−3,n−3,n−2]→[0,1,…,n−4,n−3,n−3,n−1]and the last two steps alternate)Otherwise, sinceaahas distinct elements, we claim that the answer isn−mn−m, wheremmis the number of elements in0,1,…,n−10,1,…,n−1already present in the array. Equivalently, it is the number of steps untilmax(a)<nmax(a)<nsince we always preserve the distinctness of the elements ofaa.So, we want to find the maximumiisuch thatai<nai<n. This happens exactly wheni<n−cbi<n−cb. The expected complexity isO(1)O(1)per testcase.
