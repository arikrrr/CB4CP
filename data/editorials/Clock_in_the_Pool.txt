Let's write down intervals when the clock shows time using formulas. Segments are [3k⋅x+2k,3k⋅(x+1))[3k⋅x+2k,3k⋅(x+1)) for all integer x≥0x≥0.We need to find the first interval that finished later than mm. It may start either earlier or later than mm, but it must finish later than mm.In formulas, it means that we should find the minimum xx such that m<3k⋅(x+1)m<3k⋅(x+1) or x>m3k−1x>m3k−1. It means that we should take x=floor(m3k)x=floor(m3k).Since now we know xx, we can calculate when the xx-th interval starts: it's moment 3kx+2k3kx+2k. If 3kx+2k>m3kx+2k>m, we should wait exactly 3kx+2k−m3kx+2k−m seconds. If 3kx+2k≤m3kx+2k≤m, then time is showing right now, and we don't need to wait.
