Let's fix the index of the element to be copied (denote it as ii). For all other elements of the array, the number of required operations is |aj−bj||aj−bj| for all j≠ij≠i.Consider the case when ai≤biai≤bi (similar to the case when ai≥biai≥bi). There are three possible relative location of the desired element bn+1bn+1:As you can see, regardless of the case, |bi−ai||bi−ai| is also added to the answer. So the answer looks like this: ∑j=1n|bj−aj|∑j=1n|bj−aj| plus some extra operations to get bn+1bn+1. That extra value is equal to the minimum value of f(i)f(i) over all indices ii, where f(i)f(i) is equal to 1+|bn+1−ai|1+|bn+1−ai| or 11 or 1+|bn+1−bi|1+|bn+1−bi| depending on the cases described above.
