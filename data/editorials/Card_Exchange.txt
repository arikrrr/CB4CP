If you don't initially have at least kk copies of any number, you can't perform any operations, so the answer is nn.Otherwise, we can show that we can always get down to k−1k−1 cards, with the following algorithm:Since the total number of cards decreases at each step, this process will always terminate, so you will always end up with k−1k−1 cards.Also, since the total number of cards decreases by exactly 11 at each step, and you can't do any operations if you have less than kk cards, it is impossible to do better than k−1k−1, so our solution of k−1k−1 is optimal.Complexity: O(n)O(n) or O(nlogn)O(nlog⁡n) depending on implementation.
