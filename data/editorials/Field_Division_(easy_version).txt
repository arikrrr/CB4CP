Since Alice can only move down or to the right, if in the ii-th row xx cells belong to her, then in the (i−1)(i−1)-th row she can have no more than xx cells. The construction of the maximum plot can be represented as follows: we will go through the rows from bottom to top and keep track of how many cells we have collected in the row below. In the current row, we will collect either the same number of cells, or all the cells up to the leftmost fountain in the row, if there are fewer such cells.There are three possible positions of the fountains relative to the boundary with Alice's plot:The area of Alice's plot changes only when removing the third type of fountain position, which we will call the corner. Since a corner has formed, in the row below Alice had more cells, and when removing this fountain, she will be able to take at least one cell with this fountain, and the answer for it will be 11. For the other two types of positions, removing the fountain will not change the size of the plot, and the answer for them will be 00 (you can proof it by yourself).To ensure that the solution does not depend on the size of the field, we will sort the fountains in descending order of the xx coordinate, and in case of equality of xx, in ascending order of the yy coordinate. We will iterate through the fountains in this order, keep track of the coordinates of the last corner, and update the answer when a new corner is found.
