Since the string is length at most 1010, we can try all swaps of two characters of the string. This is O(|s|2)O(|s|2) per test case, which is fast enough. If none of them create a different string, then all characters in the original string are the same, so the answer is NO.Bonus: Actually, it's enough to try all swaps with the first character, solving the problem in O(|s|)O(|s|). Why?
