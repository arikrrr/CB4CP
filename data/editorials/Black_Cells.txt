2026B - Black CellsFirst, let's consider the case whennnis even. It is not difficult to notice that to minimize the value ofkk, the cells have to be painted in the following pairs:(a1,a2)(a1,a2),(a3,a4)(a3,a4), ...,(an−1,an)(an−1,an). Then the answer is equal to the maximum of the distances between the cells in the pairs.For oddnn, it is necessary to add one more cell (so that cells can be divided into pairs). If we add a new cell from the segment(ai,ai+1)(ai,ai+1), it's paired either with theii-th cell or with the(i+1)(i+1)-th cell (depending on the parity ofii). Therefore, to minimize the value ofkk, the new cell should be chosen among(ai+1)(ai+1)and(ai+1−1)(ai+1−1)(in fact, only one of the two options is needed, but we can keep both). Note that one of these options may already be an existing cell, in which case it does not need to be considered. Thus, there areO(n)O(n)options for the new cell, and for each of them, we can calculate the answer inO(n)O(n)orO(nlogn)O(nlog⁡n), and take the minimum among them.Thus, we obtained a solution inO(n2)O(n2)(orO(n2logn)O(n2log⁡n)depending on the implementation). There is also a faster solution inO(n)O(n), but it was not required for this problem.
