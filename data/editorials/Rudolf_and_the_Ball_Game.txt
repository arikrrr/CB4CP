Let's introduce a set of unique elements qq, initially containing a single element xx — the index of the first player who started the game. For each ii from 11 to mm, we will update qq in such a way as to maintain the set of players who could have the ball after the ii-th throw. For each element qjqj of the set qq, we will remove qjqj from qq, and also:After the mm-th iteration of the described cyclic process, the set qq will contain the desired indices of all players who could have the ball at the end of the game.At each iteration of the loop, the power of qq does not exceed nn, and a total of exactly mm iterations will be performed. Thus, the asymptotic complexity of the algorithm is of the order O(n∗m)O(n∗m).
