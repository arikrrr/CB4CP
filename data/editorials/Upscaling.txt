You just need to implement what is written. One way is to go cell-by-cell in a regular n×nn×n checkerboard, and construct the larger one one cell at a time by copying cell (i,j)(i,j) into cells (2i,2j)(2i,2j), (2i+1,2j)(2i+1,2j), (2i,2j+1)(2i,2j+1), (2i+1,2j+1)(2i+1,2j+1).A faster solution is to notice that if we round down coordinates (x,y)(x,y) in the enlarged checkerboard to (⌊x2⌋,⌊y2⌋)(⌊x2⌋,⌊y2⌋), we get the corresponding cell in the original checkerboard. And to output a regular checkerboard, we output ## if the sum of coordinates is even, and .. if it is odd.So the faster implementation is: iterate over all cells (x,y)(x,y) in the 2n×2n2n×2n checkerboard. If ⌊x2⌋+⌊y2⌋⌊x2⌋+⌊y2⌋ is even output ##, else output ...
