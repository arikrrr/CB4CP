There's no real idea in the problem, the main difficulty is the implementation.Many programming languages have functions to check if a character is a digit or if it's a letter. They can be used to check that no digit follows a letter.How does the order check work? Well, most languages allow you to compare characters with inequality signs (so, we have to check that si≤si+1si≤si+1 for all corresponding ii — separately for digits and letters). How does that work? Inside the language, every character is assigned a code. That's called an ASCII table. It contains digits, letters and lots of other characters. And the less or equal check uses that table.If you look at the table carefully, you'll notice that the digits come before the lowercase Latin letters. Digits have codes from 48 to 57 and the lowercase letters have codes from 97 to 122. Thus, you can ignore the check that the digits come before the letters and just make sure that all characters of the string (regardless of their types) and sorted in a non-decreasing order.For example, you can sort the string and compare the result with the original string. If they are the same, then the answer is "YES". Alternatively, you can use function is_sorted if your language has it.Overall complexity: O(n)O(n) or O(nlogn)O(nlog⁡n) per testcase.
