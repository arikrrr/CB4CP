Let xx be the value of the cube with the number ff.Let's sort all the cubes by non-growth. Then let's look at the value of the kk-th cube in order. Since the cubes are removed by non-growth, all cubes with large values will be removed, some (perhaps not all) cubes with the same value, and cubes with smaller values will not be removed.If the value of the kk-th cube is greater than xx, then Dmitry's favorite cube will not be removed, because all the removed cubes will have more values. If it is less than xx, then the favorite cube will always be removed, since the cube with the lower value will also be removed.If the value of the kk th cube is equal to xx, then some cubes with this value will be removed. However, if there are several such cubes, then perhaps not all of them will be removed. If the k+1k+1th cube is missing (for k=nk=n) or if its value is less than xx, then all cubes with this value will be removed, and the answer is YES. Otherwise, only a part of the cubes with the value xx will be removed, and the answer is MAYBE, because cubes with the same values are indistinguishable when sorting.
