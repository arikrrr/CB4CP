What will be answer if there were only 44 elements in the array?Suppose if there were only 44 elements in the array. Let them be a≤b≤c≤da≤b≤c≤d. Then the answer will be maximum of the three cases which are listed as follows:-so clearly 2∗(d+c)−2∗(a+b)2∗(d+c)−2∗(a+b) is the maximum.So, to maximize this we can set dd, cc as large as possible and aa, bb as small as possible i.e. d=and=an, c=an−1c=an−1, b=a2b=a2 and a=a1a=a1 where aiai means ithith element in sorted order of given array.
