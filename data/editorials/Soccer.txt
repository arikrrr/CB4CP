In all cases where the first team initially led the score, and then the second team, there will be a moment when the score is equal, so it is enough to check only this condition. If it is met, the answer is "NO", otherwise the answer is "YES".Let's demonstrate how events could have unfolded without an equal score, if the condition is not met. Let x1>y1x1>y1 and x2>y2x2>y2, then the events could have occurred as follows:(x1+1x1+1) : y1y1(x1+2x1+2) : y1y1...x2x2 : y1y1x2x2 : (y1+1y1+1)x2x2 : (y1+2y1+2)...x2x2 : y2y2
