We can show that a solution always exists. This example with n=3n=3, m=5m=5, k=4k=4 will demonstrate the construction we will use:First, extend each of the even columns up by n+k−1n+k−1 spaces, keeping all cubes in a given vertical column the same color:Then, for the odd columns, do something similar, except we use the bottom n−1n−1 rows to "bend" them around so the tops point out to the right:After that, extend each of these new "bent" rows (each of which corresponds to an input cube in an odd column) to the right by kk:Now, each initial cube in the nn by mm grid corresponds to one of these extended rows or columns, each of which is a connected group. Fill in the remaining columns between the even columns with kk rows each. The ii-th of these should be color ii.Now do the same for the odd columns:At this point, each cell of a given color is connected to at least one of the rows/columns we added in the last two steps. Now, we want to connect all of those by color. Start by adding these kk rows:Followed by these k−1k−1 rows:Once again, at this point, each cube of a given color is connected to one of the rows of that color we added in the last two steps. So the last remaining step is to connect them:Now, all cubes of each color are connected.This construction uses exactly (n+k)2m−(k−1)2(m−1)−nm(n+k)2m−(k−1)2(m−1)−nm additional cubes. Since n,m,k≤50n,m,k≤50, this is at most 379,851379,851, which fits within the bounds of the problem.Complexity: O((n+k)2m)O((n+k)2m)
