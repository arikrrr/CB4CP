There are two observations to solve the problem:Proof: let's denote the sum of the numbers as ss, the smallest number as s2−as2−a and the largest number as s2+as2+a. Then the product is equal to (s2−a)(s2+a)=(s2)2−a2(s2−a)(s2+a)=(s2)2−a2. We can see that, the smaller aa (the half of difference), the larger the product.In order to get the minimum difference, we can use the following algorithm: let ii be the smallest index (the most significant digit) such that xi≠yixi≠yi and set the maximum digit among xixi and yiyi to the number xx and smallest to the number yy; thus xx is definitely greater than yy, then the less significant digits should be the maximum possible for the number yy (i. e. the inequality xj≤yjxj≤yj must hold for all j>ij>i).
