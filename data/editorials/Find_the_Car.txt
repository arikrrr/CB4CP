For each query, we binary search to find the last sign we passed (since the array aa is sorted). Say it is arar. Then, brbr minutes have passed.To find out how much time has passed since we left that sign, we know that the speed between sign rr and r+1r+1 is ar+1−arbr+1−brdistanceminutear+1−arbr+1−brdistanceminute (by the usual formula for speed).We have passed a distance c−arc−ar since the last sign, so the total number of minutes since the last sign isBe careful about using floating-point numbers, as they can behave strangely. Our solution below doesn't use them at all.
