2028D - Alice's Adventures in CardsWe will use DP to answer the following question for eachaafromnndown to11: is it possible to trade up from cardaato cardnn?To answer this question efficiently, we need to determine for each of the three players whether there exists someb>ab>asuch thatp(b)<p(a)p(b)<p(a)and it is possible to trade up from cardbbto cardnn. We can do this efficiently by keeping track for each player the minimum valuex=p(b)x=p(b)over allbbthat can reachnn: then, for a givenaawe can check for each player ifp(a)p(a)exceedsxx. If it does for some player, we can then update the valuesxxfor each of the three players. Alongside these minimum valuesxxwe can keep track of thebbachieving them to be able to reconstruct a solution.This takes timeO(n)O(n)since each iteration takes timeO(1)O(1).
