First, in the array b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn, the number dmdm must be present. Second, if ai=biai=bi, we will not apply any operations to ii. All extra operations can be applied to ajaj, where bj=dmbj=dm, they will be overwritten by the operation dmdm. For all other ii (ai≠biai≠bi) we must apply the operation dk=bidk=bi, so it remains to check that the multiset of such bibi is included in the multiset d1,d2,…,dmd1,d2,…,dm.This solution can be implemented using sorting and two pointers or std::map, resulting in a time complexity of O((n+m)logn)O((n+m)log⁡n). If you used std::unordered_map or dict, you were most likely hacked. Check out this post.
