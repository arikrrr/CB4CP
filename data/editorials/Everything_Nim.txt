If the smallest pile is of size 11, then Alice must choose k=1k=1 in her first move. Therefore, we can imagine subtracting 11 from all piles, and determining who wins given that Bob goes first. We can repeat this process, switching the first player back and forth, until there is no longer a pile of size 11. At this point, we are in one of two states:To implement this solution, we only need to keep track of the largest pile size aa, and the smallest positive integer bb that is not a pile size (essentially the MEX of the pile sizes, excluding 00).If b>ab>a, then Alice and Bob will be forced to choose k=1k=1 until the end of the game, so the parity of aa determines the winner. Otherwise, they will eventually reach a state with minimum pile size at least 22, so the parity of bb determines the winner.Complexity: O(n)O(n) or O(nlogn)O(nlog‚Å°n) depending on implementation
