There are two main ways to solve this problem: brute force and casework.To solve this problem with brute force, you can use three nested loops to iterate on the number of coins of each type from 00 to nn, check if they give exactly nn burles in total, and update the answer. This can be optimized in many different ways, like iterating only on the number of coins worth 33 and 55 burles and calculating the number of coins worth 11 burle in O(1)O(1). However, the approach with three nested loops works in O(n3)O(n3) and is fast enough.The solution with casework basically works because of an observation that if nn is big enough (88 or greater), it can always be expressed as the sum of 33's and/or 55's. So, we can get the answers for n≤7n≤7 by hand and if n>7n>7, jsut output 00. This observation is kinda intuitive, but if you want a proof, you can use Chicken McNugget Theorem (in my opinion, one of the coolest names for a math topic!)
