2039B - Shohag Loves StringsTHOUGHT:The condition seems hard to track. So a good way is to play around with smaller cases and see if we can make some observations.ACTION:Let's start with the smallest string. Whens=s=a, the number of unique substringsf(s)=1f(s)=1, so it's odd and not valid.OBSERVATION:No one length strings are valid.ACTION:Let's try the next smallest strings.Whens=s=aa,f(s)=2f(s)=2, so it's even and valid.Whens=s=ab,f(s)=3f(s)=3, so it's odd and not valid.OBSERVATION:Two length strings are valid if the adjacent characters are same.THOUGHT:So ifsscontains two consecutive same characters, we can print it right away. All that remains is to consider strings without two consecutive same characters.ACTION:Let's try the next smallest strings with adjacent different characters.Whens=s=aba,f(s)=5f(s)=5, so it's odd and not valid.Whens=s=abc,f(s)=6f(s)=6, so it's even and valid.OBSERVATION:Three length strings are valid if all characters are different.THOUGHT:So ifsscontains three consecutive different characters, we can print it right away.All that remains is to consider strings without two adjacent same characters but no three consecutive different characters.So all the remaining strings are of the forms=s=abababababa...Let's try to see if we can make some observations about these strings.ACTION:Let's try to calculate the number of unique substrings for a string of the forms=s=abababababa...There are exactly22unique substrings of length11:aandb.There are exactly22unique substrings of length22:abandba.There are exactly22unique substrings of length33:abaandbab.……There are exactly22unique substrings of lengthn−1n−1.However, the lengthnnsubstring occurs exactly once.OBSERVATION:The number of unique substrings of any length is22. But only the lengthnnsubstring occurs exactly once. So total number of unique substrings is2n−12n−1. And this is always odd! So there is no solution for these strings.THOUGHT:We have covered all the cases.CONCLUSION:If there are adjacent same characters, we can print it right away. If there are three consecutive different characters, we can print it right away. Otherwise there is no solution.Time Complexity:O(n)O(n).
