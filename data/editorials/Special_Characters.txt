Let's look at the blocks of consecutive equal characters (such that it cannot be extended to the left or to the right):We can see that there is no way to obtain an odd number of special characters. So the answer is NO for all odd values of nn. And we can easily build the string for all even values of nn. The answer for an even nn may look like this: AABBAABB... with n2n2 blocks of length 22 alternating between two different letters.
